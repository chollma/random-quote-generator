# Random Quote Generator
> A JavaScript application that randomly selects pre-defined quotes from an object and displays them on the screen while changing the background color of the document. 

## Background
I built this project as part of my Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree provided by Treehouse. It utilizes vanilla JavaScript to generate a random number, use that number to access an array of quotes and citations. In another function, I used the same random number generator to randomly select a color from an array and change the background color of the document.
  
## Running the Project
To see the project in action, clone this repository to your desktop and open index.html in a browser. The script should automatically run and display a new quote and a different background color in 10 seconds time.
